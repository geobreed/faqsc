saya ada masalah dengan report CbCr . sudah 3 x saya submit document, selalu gagal di validasi Could you please send the file to the Indonesian tax authority again and ask them why the system shows error as the file already does not contain OECD10, OECD11, OECD12 or OECD13 DocType, only OECD0 and OECD2. Hence, such error should not be posted. Also, the file is not protected and can be opened. Mohon solusinya?
