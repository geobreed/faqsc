We have been reporting the tax withholdings in the DJP portal online through the e-filing option as shown in the below screenshot. This month we have both regular tax payment and Severance tax payment for reporting and payment has been made under “Jenis setoran” 100 for regular tax and 410 for severance tax. The payment details were provided in the e-SPT portal and the CSV file was extracted and uploaded in the DJP portal for filing but only the regular tax amount is getting reflected, So kindl
