P3B Indonesia-Ceko, royalti gimana?

---

maks 12,5% ; royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the laws of that State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the royalties the tax so charged shall not exceed 12.5 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties.
