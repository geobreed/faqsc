Good day to you. We would like to get a clarification regarding the VAT Input Claim stated under Art 9(c) Harmonized Tax Law No.7 as per below screenshot. Kindly confirm whether the status of VAT assessment is fully agreed or partially agreed also can be accepted? For example, if the tax payers continues to object partially to the VAT input correction, can they claim for the partial agreed-upon VAT input? We appreciate your kind assistance on our request and hope to hear from you soon. Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact us. Thanks, Dayang

Iya betul.. balikin ke PMK 18/ 2021 Pasal 68 ayat 1 dan ayat 4a aja yaa.. bisa digarisbawahi yang "PKP menyetujui seluruh hasil pemeriksaan atas ketetapan pajak" dan "tidak dilakukan upaya hukum atas ketetapan pajak". Syaratnya kumulatif..
