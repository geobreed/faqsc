#2Q (email) : Dear Sir/Madam Hoping you are doing well! This is Hugo, accounting for a Singapore company. I am writing to confirm the taxes involved in a transaction. Recently, we plan to pay the royalties of music to an Indonesian company. and they will allow us to publish their music only in Indonesia. I wonder what type of taxes we should pay to the IndonesiaTax department, for example, VAT. And how we can pay the tax? Thank you for your time and looking for your reply! Best Regards, Hugo
