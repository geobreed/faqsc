#58Q Email Dear Sir/Madam, Thanks for the response. As per the below example if 3 employees are in receipt of severance pay then count should be mentioned as 3 in column 4, If in case for 2 employees out of 3 the severance pay does not fall under the taxable slab i.e., withholding tax is “0“ then, should those 2 employees be considered for the count? Please clarify if the count should be shown as 1 or 3 in that case. Best Regards, Pavithra
